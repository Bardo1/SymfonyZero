SymfonyZero
================

# What is?
 
SymfonyZero is a free fully functional kickstarter edition. You can use it as a base for your Symfony web projects with a typical architecture. SymfonyZero includes the most common bundles preconfigured and the usual sections of a website.

In this documentation you can learn about how to install, configure, what bundles and sections are availables and how you can help to imporove it. SymfonyZero is an alive project and we'll be adding new features and improvements, so stay tuned for new updates.

If you detect an error, you know how to improve it or you have an idea about this edition, please, fix it, do it or write us!
